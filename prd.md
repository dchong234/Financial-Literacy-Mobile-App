# Project Requirement Document (PRD): Financial Literacy Mobile App

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name:** Financial Literacy App (Working Title)
**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Duration:** 3 Weeks (12/16/25 - 01/06/25)
**Platform:** Mobile App (iOS/Android)

## 2. Problem Statement & Design Question
**Core Question:** How can we help financially illiterate adults effectively allocate their disposable income across various growth mediums (Roth IRA, stocks, savings, etc.) and guide them in setting up the right financial accounts for their future?

*Note: This question serves as the initial guide and may be refined based on insights gathered during the UX Research phase.*

## 3. Goals & Objectives

    *   Understand the specific pain points of the target audience regarding investment vehicles and asset allocation.
    *   Design an intuitive, accessible user interface suitable for users with low financial literacy.
    *   Implement features for tracking asset allocation and providing personalized account recommendations based on user demographics (age, income).

## 4. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Adults with limited financial literacy.
*   **Characteristics:** Likely overwhelmed by complex financial jargon, struggle with budgeting, and lack confidence in investment decisions.

## 5. Team & Roles
*   **UX Designer (1):** Responsible for UX Research, Wireframing, Prototyping, and UI Design.
*   **Developer (1):** Responsible for Technical Feasibility Assessment, Architecture, Frontend/Backend Development, and Mobile Implementation.

## 7. Functional Requirements (MVP)
*   **Onboarding:** Simple, jargon-free introduction to the app.
*   **Asset Allocation Tracking:** Track distribution of funds across different mediums (Cash, Savings, Stocks, Roth IRA, etc.) rather than granular daily expenses.
*   **Account Setup Guidance:** Step-by-step resources and guides to help users open necessary accounts (e.g., "How to open a Roth IRA").
*   **Smart Recommendations:** Logic/AI to recommend specific account types and allocation strategies based on user inputs (Age, Income, Risk Tolerance).
*   **Dashboard:** Visual summary of current asset distribution vs. recommended goals.

## 8. Success Metrics
*   Completion of all 4 phases within the 3-week timeline.
*   User feedback indicating the app is easy to understand (from usability testing).
