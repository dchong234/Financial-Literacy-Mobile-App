**Participant:** Brian (Recent Graduate, Engineer)
**Interviewer:** UX Researcher
**Topic:** Financial Anxiety & Investing Barriers

---

## 1. Concise Summary
Brian is a recent engineering graduate who defines financial literacy as the ability to budget, save, and manage spending relative to income. He is currently navigating a period of financial instability due to a layoff and the recent holiday season. While he actively tracks his net worth and expenses using tools like NerdWallet, he experiences anxiety stemming from income loss and data synchronization lags between his bank and tracking apps. He views investing primarily as "stocks" and relies on social media, online resources (Investopedia), and family for financial education. He is interested in low-risk investing but prioritizes debt repayment first.

## 2. Key Themes & Patterns
*   **Safety First Approach:** Prioritizes paying off debts (credit cards) before aggressive investing.
*   **Reactive Monitoring:** Checks bank accounts primarily when triggered by external pressures (bills due, lack of income) rather than proactive wealth building.
*   **Reliance on Digital Tools:** Uses NerdWallet and banking apps but is frustrated by technical inconsistencies.
*   **Social & Familial Influence:** Financial knowledge is socially derived (Dad, Social Media trends, Investopedia).
*   **Emotional Spending/Stress:** Holiday season and "severance pay" mindset triggered spending stress; anxiety is linked directly to "money out" vs. "money in."

## 3. Pain Points & Frictions
*   **Data Lag & Inaccuracy:** Frustrated by the delay between his bank (Wells Fargo) and tracking app (NerdWallet).
    *   *“There is a bit of delay... inconsistency in data.”*
*   **Income Instability Anxiety:** High stress related to managing severance pay and holiday spending without current income.
    *   *“Knowing he had a lot to spend for other people but not having an abundance to spend for others.”*
*   **Information overload/Uncertainty:** Feels there is a "right way" (common sense like paying debt) but feels like he is "free-balling" the rest.
*   **Tracking Effort:** Checks accounts once or twice a week specifically to "regulate spending," implying it requires conscious, stressful effort.

## 4. Needs, Motivations & Jobs-To-Be-Done
*   **Need for Real-Time Clarity:** Users need real-time data synchronization because lagging data causes anxiety about their actual financial standing.
*   **Need for Validation:** Users need confirmation that their "common sense" approach (debt first, then invest) is valid because they feel they are otherwise "free-balling" it.
*   **Need for Safe Entry Points:** Users need low-risk/low-collateral investment options because they are cautious about losing their limited funds.
*   **JTBD:** "Help me track exactly how much I can safely spend today so I don't feel guilty about buying necessities or gifts."

## 5. Opportunities & Insights
*   **Real-time "Safe-to-Spend" Indicator:** Instead of just showing net worth/balances (which might be lagging), provide a calculated "Safe to Spend" amount that accounts for pending bills.
*   **Education features:** Brian relies on Investopedia and family. Integration of bite-sized, verified definitions (e.g., "What is an ETF vs. Stock") within the transaction view could bridge his knowledge gap.
*   **Debt-to-Investment Bridge:** Explicitly guide the user on *when* to switch from debt payoff to investing. A feature that says, "Great job paying off that card! Now is a safe time to invest $50."
*   **Normalize "Free-balling":** Use reassuring copy that validates the user's current stage (e.g., "Paying off debt is the best first investment").

## 6. Research Takeaways
*   **Latency Induces Anxiety:** For anxious users, even a 1-day lag in data syncing breaks trust and causes stress. The app must prioritize real-time updates or explicitly state when data was last synced.
*   **"Investing" = "Stocks" (Risky):** Users like Brian conflate "investing" solely with "stocks" and "trends." The app needs to broaden this definition to include safer, boring vehicles (bonds, high-yield savings) to lower the psychological barrier to entry.
*   **Contextual Triggers:** Financial checking is often triggered by specific events (end of paycheck, credit card bill due). Notifications should be timed around these cycles to be helpful rather than intrusive.
*   **Social Proof is Critical:** Since he listens to "social media" and "dad," the app's advice should feel like "wisdom from a trusted peer/mentor" rather than cold institutional mandates.
